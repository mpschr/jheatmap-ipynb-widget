IPython-jHeatmap
==================

stolen and adapted from https://github.com/jdfreder/ipython-d3.git

This directory contains example code and notebooks that show how D3.js can be used in combination with NetworkX and the IPython notebook widget framework to make some really cool, interactive, force directed graphs.


- `demo simple.ipynb`
  **Start here** for a demonstration of how the API can be used.
- `demo generators.ipynb`
  This example uses built-in NetworkX generators to render some interesting graphs.
- `demo factor.ipynb`
  This is a small example that factors a number between 0-100.
- `demo twitter.ipynb`
  This example renders Twitter retweets in realtime.
